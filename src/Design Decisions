- Every note has an ID ranging from 1 to 12. Basically like a clock. [There is no 0]
- Note also has an octave; the notes on different octaves (e.g. A on octave 3 and another A
on octave 4) are considered to be different notes.
- Human ear can only hear frequencies from 20Hz to 20KHz. Accordingly, 10 octaves are
possible to hear; 1 being the lowest and 10 being the highest.

A ("A","A", NoteType.NATURAL, 1, null),
B ("B","B", NoteType.NATURAL, 3, null),
C ("C","C", NoteType.NATURAL, 4, null),
D ("D","D", NoteType.NATURAL, 6, null),
E ("E","E", NoteType.NATURAL, 8, null),
F ("F","F", NoteType.NATURAL, 9, null),
G ("G","G", NoteType.NATURAL, 11, null),

- Chord Quality is made up of intervals. Unison must be one of the intervals.
- Chord Quality must be made up of 2 or more intervals.

- Scale formula is made up of intervals. UNISON and OCTAVE should be two of the intervals. All intervals
in the formula should be less or equal to OCTAVE (during construction of the formula).
